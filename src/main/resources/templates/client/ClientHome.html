              <p class="card-text">India became an independent democratic republic in 1947 and its constitution, which came into force on 26th November 1949,
is the supreme law.India has a common law legal system whose infrastructure bears the influence of British colonial rule. 
The constitution is based on the Government of India Act 1935 passed by British Parliament. 
The Indian constitution lays out a federal Union of 28 States, 6 union territories and 1 national capital territory. 
The Union and States have separate executive and legislative branches, whereas the territories are ruled by the national
government.Law generated by the Union is superior to that of the States.

 
<br>
<br>

The nominal head of the Union executive is an elected President, but the Prime Minister, leader of the majority party and 
head of the Union Council of Ministers, is more politically powerful. India has a bicameral Parliament whose upper house 
is the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) and whose lower house is the House of People (Lok Sabha).The State executive is headed
by a Governor, and while most have a unicameral legislative body called the Legislative Assembly, some are bicameral with a 
Legislative Council as well.

 <br>
 <br>

 
Apart from the English influence, personal laws are frequently based on Hindu and Islamic law.
Hindu law has been codified and Islamic law is based on authoritative commentaries and precedents.
(The LawBod has works dealing with these great religious legal systems with shelf marks starting Ancient Hindu and Islamic).
